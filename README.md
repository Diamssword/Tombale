This mod will place a Tombstone when you die and collect your items instead of them laying around.

The tombstone can be safely retrieved by interacting with it.

The tombstone will be placed on the nearest free block, and the coordinates will be sent to you in the chat.

It respects the Death Penalties option:  
A tombstone will generate only if some items are dropped on death.
